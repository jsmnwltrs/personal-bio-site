    <p>I was born in California, but moved to Tennessee shortly after and grew up in the city of Franklin. After high school I became a certified nursing assistant and 
    worked in a assisted living facility for two years. I decided I wanted a career change and my mom was working for United Health Care at the time as a 
    Business Analyst for their EMR systems. She was able to help me get a temporary position doing simple data cleanup. After that I was able to get on full
    job working support for the new EMR system they had rolled out. I got to work closely with developers and quickly gained interest in what they were doing.
    I enjoyed helping them test and debug the system. 
    After a few years with the company I decided to go back to school to learn more about web development. My boyfriend's mom was interested in Nashville 
    Software School at the time and she suggested that I look into it. I decided to apply and go to an interview. I was gratefully accepted. After a few
    weeks of classes, I decided to leave my job and take the time to focus on school. I had wanted to leave health care eventually and find out what else I 
    could do with web development skills. </p>
