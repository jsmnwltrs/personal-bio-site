    <p id="biotext">I was born in California, but moved to Tennessee shortly after and grew up in the city of Franklin. After high school I became a 
      certified nursing assistant and started working in an assisted living facility. The job was difficult, but very rewarding. After 
      two years of working with patients, I was given an opportunity to do temporary data cleanup for United Health Care's EMR systems. 
      I did really well and I was eventually able to get a permanent position working as a Business Analyst. I got to work closely with 
      developers and quickly gained interest in what they were doing. After a few years with the company I decided to go back to school 
      to learn more about web development. A friend of mine was interested in Nashville Software School at the time and she suggested 
      that I look into it. I was deligthed to find a program that seemed well suited for me.

      I really enjoy developing now. I love that there is always something to learn. I've had a lot of fun meeting people and discussing 
      new ideas and projects. I am really interested in what the Nashville tech community is doing and can't wait to see what others are 
      working on.
