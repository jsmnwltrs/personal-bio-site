  <p id="biotext">I was born in California, but moved to Tennessee shortly after and grew up in the city of Franklin. After high school I became a 
    certified nursing assistant and started working in an assisted living facility. The job was difficult, but very rewarding. After 
    two years of working with patients, I was given an opportunity to do temporary data cleanup for United Health Care's EMR systems. 
    I did really well and I was eventually able to get a permanent position working as a Business Analyst. I got to work closely with 
    developers and quickly gained interest in what they were doing. After a few years with the company I decided to go to Nashville Software School
    to learn more about web developement. I enjoy solving problems and learning from others. Discussing new projects and ideas has helped 
    me understand individuals' viewpoints and perspectives. Iâ€™m excited to get involved and build relationships with members of the Nashville tech community.
